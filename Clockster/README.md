## Overview ##
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The data provided by the HR department of the medical company includes 10-15 parameters per day per year (arrival/departure time, vacations, sick days, time off, etc) on 1000+ employees of the company.
</p>

## Data Analysis Goals ##

1. Identify the most disciplined and undisciplined employees and divisions
2. Provide analysis of weekdays and months when the most employees were late/absent (either for vacation or sick leave)
3. Which heads of departments tend to forgive employees for lack of discipline? Are there any favorites for any heads of departments (perhaps some employees are always forgiven for being late, given time off, etc.)?
